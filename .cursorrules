# Cursor AI Rules for BetterFeed

## Always Update llms.txt

When making changes to the project, **ALWAYS** update `llms.txt` to reflect:
- New dependencies added to `package.json`
- New API routes created in `pages/api/`
- Changes to database schema in `lib/db/schema.ts`
- Modifications to project structure
- New environment variables required
- Updates to tech stack or versions

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow Next.js Pages Router conventions
- Use Supabase client for all database operations
- Use `handleApiError()` for consistent error handling
- Use `withAuth()` wrapper for protected routes
- Follow existing file structure and naming conventions

## Project Structure

- Keep API routes in `pages/api/`
- Keep database schema in `lib/db/schema.ts`
- Keep shared utilities in `lib/`
- Keep type definitions in `types/`
- Do not create a monorepo structure - this is a single repository
